Welcome to this unconfigured RGTP server.

This file should contain the email address of the server's administrators.
(Until then, if you'd like to know more about this server, you could try
emailing "root@" + the name of this machine and asking about it.) It can
also contain news of recent updates, downtime, and so on.

Spurge doesn't yet support editing of this file via RGTP; it should be in
the next version. Until then, to change this message, you will need to edit
the "motd" file manually; please leave the top line as it is, since this is
required by the protocol.

This server is running the Spurge RGTP daemon. For more information, please
visit <http://rgtp.thurman.org.uk/spurge/>.
