    <title>DESCRIPTION</title>

    <para>&dhpackage; is a server for the Reverse Gossip Transfer Protocol
    (<acronym>RGTP</acronym>),
    a linear bulletin board transfer protocol first popularised on the Cambridge
    <acronym>GROGGS</acronym> system.</para>

    <para>This manual page is still a work in progress. Much is not yet
    documented that should be.</para>

  </refsect1>

  <refsect1>
    <title>A BRIEF OVERVIEW OF REVERSE GOSSIP</title>

    <para>An RGTP-based bulletin board consists of a series of items,
    identified by an itemid (a code of the form A1234567) and a subject line.
    Each item acts as a separate discussion forum. Users may append comments
    to the end of any item below a certain size; once an item reaches maximum
    length, a new item must be created. This helps reduce the subject drift between
    the stated subject of an item and its actual topic which is so common on Usenet.
    The server tracks which items are continuations of which, thus
    forming threads.</para>

  <refsect1>
    <title>OPTIONS</title>
    <para>Most of the command-line options do nothing useful yet.
    However, these do have a useful function:</para>

    <variablelist>

      <varlistentry>
        <term><option>--help</option>
        </term>
        <listitem>
          <para>Prints a brief (too brief) message and quits.</para>
        </listitem>
      </varlistentry>

      <varlistentry>
        <term><option>--vault</option> <replaceable>vault name</replaceable>
        </term>
        <listitem>
          <para>Selects a vault other than the default. If you don't give this option,
          the vault "default" is used.</para>
        </listitem>
      </varlistentry>

      <varlistentry>
        <term><option>--no-logging</option>
        </term>
        <listitem>
          <para>
	  Turns off logging, just for this run. This is especially useful when
	  you want to run &dhpackage; from the command line; if a vault is set
	  up to write logs, it will fail with a permissions error when you
	  run it as an ordinary user unless you turn the logging off.
	  </para>
        </listitem>
      </varlistentry>

     </variablelist>

  </refsect1>

    <title>WHAT'S WITH THESE 484 ERRORS?</title>

    <para>484 is the RGTP general failure error, rather like 500 in HTTP.
    If &dhpackage; runs into an error that it can't possibly handle, it will
    display it as a 484 error, so that the error message will be propagated
    to the client. The upshot of all this is that fatal error messages are
    printed with the number 484 at the start.</para>

    <para>If you're debugging, it may be useful to see a stack trace of
    where the crash occurred printed after the 484 message. See
    the "tracebacks" option in CONFIGURATION, below, to find out how
    to get this.</para>

    <para>If you see a 484 error and you think
    it shouldn't have happened, please do mail spurge@thurman.org.uk with
    information about what was happening. If the error's repeatable,
    including a traceback would be useful too.</para>
  </refsect1>

  <refsect1>
    <title>CONFIGURATION</title>

    <para>If a vault contains a file named "config", spurge will load settings
    from that file. It will read global settings from the file "/etc/spurge.conf" as well,
    but settings in "config" overrule those in "/etc/spurge.conf".</para>

    <para>Here are the values that can be set in the "[main]" paragraph:</para>

    <variablelist>

        <listitem>
          <para>If 1, users can browse the server without logging in,

        </term>
        <listitem>
          <para>If this is defined, the server will not start when
          invoked; instead, it will produce the given text as an

          work. </para>

          have one added to fatal error messages; set it to 0 not to.

    <para>In addition, a configuration file may define boilerplate
    text to be produced by the server, in "[codes]" and "[lang"... sections.

    to cover it.</para>

    <title>THE VAULT</title>

    <para>Each invocation of spurge works within one particular directory,
    called a vault. On installation, there is only one vault, called "default",
    but you may create others. (Future versions of spurge will have the
    capacity to do this automatically.)</para>

    <para>Vaults usually live underneath the directory /usr/lib/spurge. The minimal
    vault is simply an empty directory; it may also contain one or more of the following
    files:</para>

    <variablelist>

      <varlistentry>
        <term><option>A1240111</option>
        </term>
        <listitem>
          <para>(and similar names.) Item text. The name is known as an "itemid"; it consists of
          one letter indicating the year (A being 1986, R being 2002) and seven numbers.
          (The year after Z year is A year again.)</para>
